#About Me

I am a Denver based photographer specializing in fetish, boudoir and lifestyle studio sessions. I photograph non-fetish studio shoots and events as well, my portfolio for this can be found on my website and on my Facebook page . Pearl Noir's name was concieved by the type of photography I really enjoy, elegant and artistic exposures, techniques and filter use. Off course nothing is more classy than pearls and film-noir!

Message me about how to get a studio session for FREE!

I work on location (outside or inside), primarily in the Denver/ metro area, including beautiful mountain settings. I typically use 3-4 different filter styles which can be chosen during your consultation. My studio is complete with flash strobes, filters, continuous lighting, a beauty dish, many back drops, furniture, props and accessories to compliment your studio session. A private dressing room and bathroom is available for every studio session. Your choice of music can be played during any shoot, otherwise you'll have to listen to my music ;)
